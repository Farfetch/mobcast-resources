# MOBCAST: Rich Text in iOS

> In this episode, Ana and Guilherme will go through a solution for building dynamic text representations used in the FARFETCH iOS App. You can find it available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUKcPphwJRE)

You'll find in this example the code produced during the episode.

You can open the `RichText.playground` to check the code and run it to see its effects.
